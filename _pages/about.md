I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [INMAN Laboratory at the University of Utah](https://inmanlab.psych.utah.edu/). I earned my B.Sc. in Electronic Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University in Iran, my M.Sc. in Bioelectronics from the University of Tehran, and my Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of California, Davis. My research is mainly focused on the foundations of human memory. I am particularly interested in understanding how different memory mechanisms are supported by the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. During my Ph.D., I used a range of methodologiesâ€”including eye-tracking, fMRI, and computational modeling to study the development of memory and its role in broader cognitive functions. In my current postdoctoral position, I am involved in the development of novel technologies to record and analyze multimodal data, including intracranial EEG, eye-tracking, and several other biomedical signals from human participants. This allows me to investigate the real-time dynamics of memory processes in the brain during naturalistic, real-life experiences. 
Outside of cognitive neuroscience, I enjoy exploring topics in theoretical physics and philosophy, and I love to engage in debates on these subjects.
